Unit Testing in Angular using Jasmine and Karma
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing  Angular Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is Testing?

-->A process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between existing and required conditions (i.e., defects) 
   and to evaluate the features of the software item.


 
Automated Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Automation Testing: Automation testing is the process of testing the software using an automation tool to find the defects. 
In this process, testers execute the test scripts and generate the test results automatically by using automation tools. 
Some of the famous automation testing tools for functional testing are QTP/UFT and Selenium.
 
 
 Unit Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Unit Testing is done to check whether the individual modules of the source code are working properly.
 i.e. testing each and every unit of the application separately by the developer in the developer’s environment.   

	
	
Angular Testing Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Jasmine
	--> Jasmine is an open-source testing framework for JavaScript. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, 
	to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, 
	such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec
	
2. Karma

	-->Karma is essentially a tool which spawns a web server that executes source code against test code for each of the browsers connected. 
	Its automatically by letting Karma know which browsers to start when Karma is run.
	
 

Test API for Angular Apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Module :   @angular/core/testing
Main API:   
					TestBed
							Configures and initializes environment for unit testing and provides methods for creating components and services in unit tests.
							TestBed is the primary api for writing unit tests for Angular applications and libraries.
							
					ComponentFixture
							Fixture for debugging and testing a component.
Methods:
					describe()
					it()
					expect()




 
 
 
 
 Codes:
 
	--> It returns the first element:
				const p = bannerElement.querySelector('p')!;
				
	-->			
 
 
 


Concept of AAA 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AAA----	Arrange, Act,  Assert





---------------------------------------------------------------------
--> Angular CLI generate all the required configuration settings at the time of creating new angular application. 

		Eg:		 angular.json,  karma.conf.js


> ng  new
> ng  serve
   ng  s
> ng  build
> ng  test
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Running Tests:
	
	
To Runs all tests in Angular App
	>	ng  test
	
To run specific *.spec.ts  file	
	>  ng  test    --include  "src/app/emps/emps.component.spec.ts"
	>  ng  test    --include  "src/app/app.component.spec.ts"


--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Angular Testing 	Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libary :		@angular/core/testing


TestBed Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~
-->	The TestBed configures and initializes environment for unit testing. 
-->	The TestBed instantiates required component and services for testing.

	const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
	
	
	--> In the above statement,   createComponent() method returns ComponentFixture class object.    
	It will be generated based on the given component.
	
ComponentFixture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	
--> The ComponentFixture is the fixture for debugging and testing a component. It is instantiated using TestBed.
To create component object using ComponentFixture, it provides componentInstance property
To access HTML element from HTML template, the ComponentFixture provides debugElement and nativeElement.
In querySelector we can pass element id or element type. 
In ComponentFixture,  debugElement and  the nativeElement to access html tags

	
	
	
1.  Should create the app ---  app component instance	
	
it('should create the app', () => {
	// Arrange
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
	
	// Act
    const app = fixture.componentInstance;
	
	// Assert
    expect(app).toBeTruthy();
 });
	
	
	
2.  Testing "title" property value -- should be "my-project"


  it(`should have as title 'my-project'`, () => {
	 
    // Arranger	 
    const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
	
	// Action
    const app = fixture.componentInstance;
	
	// Assert
    expect(app.title).toEqual('my-project');
  });	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Testing Angular components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Testing  Component  properties
2. Testing  Component  methods
3.  Testing  Component Templates ----  HTMl Tags
4.  Testing  input fields ---  textbox
5.  Testing  input fields ---  textbox --- with [(ngModel)]
6.  Testing  button click events 




Getting single element:
		const inputObj =  fixture.nativeElement.querySelector("input");		

		---> returns first matching element

Getting multiple element:
		 const inputArray =  fixture.nativeElement.querySelectorAll("input");
