Testing Services, Pipes and Http Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Testing Pipes   (Isolated testing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ng  test    --include  "src/app/gender.pipe.spec.ts"


---> We need to test the transform method input and output.
---> Write separate test cases for possible inputs.
			Eg:			a.    m --	male
							b.    f --	female
							c.    M/F   ----   male/female 
							
---> Write separate test cases for invalid input. 






2. Testing Services   (Isolated testing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--> Testing the services without dependencies.
--> Test object creation for the service.
--> Test the props and methods.




3. Testing Services   (with dependencies)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--> Testing the services with  dependencies.

Eg:  
			CalculatorService is depends on LogService
			DataService is depends on HttpClient
	
--> CalculatorService is depends on LogService


			

Using Jasmine Spies in Angular Testing to mocking the dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--> Jasmine spies are used to track or stub functions or methods. 
--> Spies are a way to check if a function was called or to provide a custom return value. 

--> We can use spies to test components/services that depend on service and avoid actually calling the serviceâ€™s methods to get a value.
